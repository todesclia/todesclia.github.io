## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [X] At least one profile picture
- [X] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [X] Functional Contact Form
- [X] "Projects" section
- [X] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [X] At least 2 web pages.
- [X] Version controlled with Git
- [X] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [X] Implements responsive design principles.
- [X] Uses semantic HTML.
      
The project is designed with three web pages: an About page, a Projects page and a Contacts page, which help organize content and provide users with clear, distinct sections for information about the site and its projects. Version control with Git is utilized to track changes, and maintain a history of the project's development. The application is deployed on GitHub Pages, leveraging its seamless integration with Git repositories for easy and reliable hosting. Responsive design principles are implemented to ensure the web pages render well on various devices and screen sizes, achieved through flex-box grids, flexible images, and media queries. Finally, the project uses semantic HTML to enhance accessibility, readability, and SEO by employing tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to clearly define the structure and meaning of the content.

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [X] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
      
The project also includes interactive styles to enhance user experience and accessibility. Specifically, different styles for active, hover, and focus states are implemented to provide visual feedback to users. For example, when users hover over articles, the color changes, indicating that the element is interactive and can be clicked. This design decision improves the usability of the web pages by making it clear which elements are actionable, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, these interactive styles contribute to better accessibility by providing visual cues for users navigating the site with a keyboard or other assistive devices. This approach ensures that the website is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and inclusive.
